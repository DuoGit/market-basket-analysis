# Market basket analysis

## Description
A *data mining* project submitted in the *elective study* course at university. The entire project was programmed in **R** programming language. *R* provides the useful *Shiny* package to host the project online as a *web application*.

## Context
Considering the situation where an owner of a grocery store wishes to find out a way to "help" customers select and buy **more** products than usual at each shopping time. By analyzing old invoices, the owner realizes that there are "connections" between the products in the store. For instance, if a customer buys coffee, then that customer is more likely to buy sugar. Thus, the owner places sugar right next to coffee, which increases the chance for sugar to be bought.
